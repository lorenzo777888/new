"Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful
life
As described in Notes 4, 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Group has recorded goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful life for an amount of USD 110 479 million and USD 36
948 million, respectively, as of 31 December 2024. Impairment analyses
of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are performed annually
and whenever a triggering event has occurred, in order to determine
whether the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount.
Impairment tests are conducted by management, in accordance with
IAS 36, in which management applies a discounted cash flow approach
based on current acquisition valuation models for its cash-generating
units showing an invested capital to EBITDA multiple above 9x and
valuation multiples for its other cash-generating units. The Group uses
a strategic plan based on external sources in respect of macro-
economic assumptions, industry, inflation and foreign exchange rates,
past experience and identified initiatives in terms of market share,
revenue, variable and fixed cost, capital expenditure and working capital
assumptions. Management’s cash flow projections include significant
judgment, estimates and assumptions, related to the weighted average
cost of capital, the terminal growth rate and the applied market multiple.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing
procedures relating to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
with indefinite useful life is a key audit matter are (i) the high degree of
auditor judgment and subjectivity in applying procedures relating to the
valuation of the cash-generating units due to the significant amount of
judgment by management when developing this estimate, (ii) the audit
effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and
knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained from
these procedures and (iii) the significant audit effort necessary in
evaluating the significant assumptions relating to the estimate, related
to the weighted average cost of capital, the terminal growth rate and the
applied market multiple.","Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and
evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our
overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
These procedures included testing the effectiveness of
controls relating to management’s goodwill and indefinite-
lived asset impairment testing, including controls over the
valuation of the Group’s cash-generating units.
These procedures also included, among others, testing
management’s process for developing the fair value
estimates; evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted
cash flow model; testing the completeness, accuracy, and
relevance of underlying data used in the models; and, with the
assistance of professionals with specialized skill and
knowledge, evaluating the significant assumptions used by
management, related to the weighted average cost of capital,
the terminal growth rate and the applied market multiple.
Evaluating management’s assumptions involved evaluating
whether the assumptions used by management were
reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance
of the cash-generating unit, (ii) the consistency with external
market and industry data, (iii) whether these assumptions
were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the
audit and (iv) analysis of sensitivities in the Group’s
discounted cash flow model."

"Uncertain tax positions
As described in Notes 4 and 29 to the consolidated financial statements,
significant judgment by management is required in determining the
worldwide provision for income tax. There are some transactions and
calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Some
subsidiaries within the group are involved in tax audits and local
enquiries usually in relation to prior years. Investigations and
negotiations with local tax authorities are ongoing in various jurisdictions
at the reporting date and, by their nature, these can take considerable
time to conclude. In assessing the amount of any income tax provisions
to be recognized in the financial statements, estimates are made of the
expected successful settlement of these matters.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing
procedures relating to uncertain tax positions is a key audit matter are
(i) the high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in applying
procedures related to uncertain tax positions due to the significant
amount of judgment by management when developing this estimate,
including a high degree of estimation uncertainty relative to the
numerous and complex tax laws, frequency of tax audits, and the
considerable time to conclude investigations and negotiations with local
tax authorities as a result of such audits, and (ii) the audit effort involved
the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist
in evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures.","Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and
evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our
overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
These procedures included testing the effectiveness of
controls relating to completeness of the uncertain tax
positions, as well as controls over measurement of the liability.
These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the
information used in the calculation of the income tax
provisions, including intercompany agreements, international,
federal, and state filing positions, and the related final tax
returns; (ii) testing the calculation of the income tax provision
by jurisdiction, including management’s assessment of the
technical merits of tax positions and estimates of the amount
of tax benefit expected to be sustained; (iii) testing the
completeness of management’s assessment of both the
identification of uncertain tax positions and possible outcomes
thereof; and (iv) evaluating the status and results of income
tax audits by the relevant tax authorities.
Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used
to assist in the evaluation of the completeness and
measurement of the Group’s uncertain tax positions, including
evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment
of the chance of loss related to tax positions and the
application of relevant tax laws."
