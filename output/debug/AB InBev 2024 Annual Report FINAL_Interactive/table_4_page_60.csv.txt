['Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful\nlife\nAs described in Notes 4, 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial\nstatements, the Group has recorded goodwill and intangible assets with\nindefinite useful life for an amount of USD 110 479 million and USD 36\n948 million, respectively, as of 31 December 2024. Impairment analyses\nof goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are performed annually\nand whenever a triggering event has occurred, in order to determine\nwhether the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount.\nImpairment tests are conducted by management, in accordance with\nIAS 36, in which management applies a discounted cash flow approach\nbased on current acquisition valuation models for its cash-generating\nunits showing an invested capital to EBITDA multiple above 9x and\nvaluation multiples for its other cash-generating units. The Group uses\na strategic plan based on external sources in respect of macro-\neconomic assumptions, industry, inflation and foreign exchange rates,\npast experience and identified initiatives in terms of market share,\nrevenue, variable and fixed cost, capital expenditure and working capital\nassumptions. Management’s cash flow projections include significant\njudgment, estimates and assumptions, related to the weighted average\ncost of capital, the terminal growth rate and the applied market multiple.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing\nprocedures relating to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets\nwith indefinite useful life is a key audit matter are (i) the high degree of\nauditor judgment and subjectivity in applying procedures relating to the\nvaluation of the cash-generating units due to the significant amount of\njudgment by management when developing this estimate, (ii) the audit\neffort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and\nknowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained from\nthese procedures and (iii) the significant audit effort necessary in\nevaluating the significant assumptions relating to the estimate, related\nto the weighted average cost of capital, the terminal growth rate and the\napplied market multiple.', 'Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and\nevaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\nThese procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s goodwill and indefinite-\nlived asset impairment testing, including controls over the\nvaluation of the Group’s cash-generating units.\nThese procedures also included, among others, testing\nmanagement’s process for developing the fair value\nestimates; evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted\ncash flow model; testing the completeness, accuracy, and\nrelevance of underlying data used in the models; and, with the\nassistance of professionals with specialized skill and\nknowledge, evaluating the significant assumptions used by\nmanagement, related to the weighted average cost of capital,\nthe terminal growth rate and the applied market multiple.\nEvaluating management’s assumptions involved evaluating\nwhether the assumptions used by management were\nreasonable considering (i) the current and past performance\nof the cash-generating unit, (ii) the consistency with external\nmarket and industry data, (iii) whether these assumptions\nwere consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the\naudit and (iv) analysis of sensitivities in the Group’s\ndiscounted cash flow model.']

['Uncertain tax positions\nAs described in Notes 4 and 29 to the consolidated financial statements,\nsignificant judgment by management is required in determining the\nworldwide provision for income tax. There are some transactions and\ncalculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Some\nsubsidiaries within the group are involved in tax audits and local\nenquiries usually in relation to prior years. Investigations and\nnegotiations with local tax authorities are ongoing in various jurisdictions\nat the reporting date and, by their nature, these can take considerable\ntime to conclude. In assessing the amount of any income tax provisions\nto be recognized in the financial statements, estimates are made of the\nexpected successful settlement of these matters.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing\nprocedures relating to uncertain tax positions is a key audit matter are\n(i) the high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in applying\nprocedures related to uncertain tax positions due to the significant\namount of judgment by management when developing this estimate,\nincluding a high degree of estimation uncertainty relative to the\nnumerous and complex tax laws, frequency of tax audits, and the\nconsiderable time to conclude investigations and negotiations with local\ntax authorities as a result of such audits, and (ii) the audit effort involved\nthe use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist\nin evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures.', 'Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and\nevaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\nThese procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to completeness of the uncertain tax\npositions, as well as controls over measurement of the liability.\nThese procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the\ninformation used in the calculation of the income tax\nprovisions, including intercompany agreements, international,\nfederal, and state filing positions, and the related final tax\nreturns; (ii) testing the calculation of the income tax provision\nby jurisdiction, including management’s assessment of the\ntechnical merits of tax positions and estimates of the amount\nof tax benefit expected to be sustained; (iii) testing the\ncompleteness of management’s assessment of both the\nidentification of uncertain tax positions and possible outcomes\nthereof; and (iv) evaluating the status and results of income\ntax audits by the relevant tax authorities.\nProfessionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used\nto assist in the evaluation of the completeness and\nmeasurement of the Group’s uncertain tax positions, including\nevaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment\nof the chance of loss related to tax positions and the\napplication of relevant tax laws.']
