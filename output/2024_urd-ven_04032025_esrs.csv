SBM-2,,section 4.1.2.2,,,2017 | 399 | 27 | 2003 | 3,374," The following disclosure is prepared in accordance with the Monitoring Act No. 2017-399 (“Duty of Vigilance Law”) and is not part of the Sustainability Statement.4.7MONITORING OF ACT NO. 2017-399 KNOWN AS THE DUTY OF VIGILANCE LAWBackground and commitmentsAir France-KLM is subject to the obligations introduced by the French Act No. 2017-399 of March 27, 2017, relating to the duty of vigilance for parent companies and ordering companies (“Duty of Vigilance Act”). In response to these regulatory requirements, Air France-KLM has implemented a vigilance plan, it being understood that Air France-KLM already had processes in place enabling it to comply with the main requirements of the Duty of Vigilance Act before the entry into force of such act. Air France-KLM has been a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact since 2003 and is committed to respecting and promoting its ten Principles notably in the areas of human rights and protection of the environment. This undertaking is reaffirmed each year by Air France-KLM’s Top Management and promoted toward our business partners.The Group’s policy also enshrines the respect of fundamental rights as established in the leading international principles: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the OECD guiding principles, notably on due diligence.Risk identification and regular risk evaluation proceduresMethodologyThe identification and evaluation of the various risks to be addressed as part of the duty of vigilance plan are part of the overall risk management process established within the Group. Please refer to Chapter 3 “Risks and risk management”.As a facilitator of risk management, the Air France-KLM Internal Audit team regularly evaluates the risk management process, and its conclusions are the subject of presentations to the Air France-KLM Executive Committee and the Audit Committee. Under the supervision of the Internal Audit team, twice a year, Air France-KLM conducts a review of the non-financial risks generated by its activities with representatives of all divisions involved. This includes risks to be addressed as part of the duty of vigilance. This analysis verifies any evolution in the likelihood and impact of identified risks compared to the previous semester and the adequacy, comprehensiveness, and efficiency of the measures and action plans aimed at the effective prevention, control, and mitigation of the non-financial risks deemed to be the most material for Air France-KLM (for more information, please refer to Chapter 3 “Risks and risk management” and section 4.1.2.2 “Interest and views of stakeholders (ESRS2 SBM-2)”).In particular, having established verification processes in the areas required to be covered by the vigilance plan, the Group has ensured that it is in a position to benefit, as effectively as possible, from the contributions of its various divisions/entities involved in the deployment of the vigilance plan through the organization (i.e., compliance, procurement, HR, and sustainability teams).As required by the Duty of Vigilance Act, Air France-KLM has also implemented measures concerning its supply chain. The identification and assessment of risks within the supply chain are part of the Air France-KLM Group’s overall sub-contracting management system, which covers all risk areas (financial and non-financial, including the environment, human and social rights, and ethical business conduct).Risks related to the supply chain are identified, assessed, and mitigated through a due diligence process. A risk classification of suppliers and service providers is performed by the Air France-KLM Group Procurement team mainly based on geographical risk and industry sector risk known for issues and incidents in environmental, social, and human rights matters. The level of risk associated with categories of suppliers and service providers will trigger some enhanced due diligence process (see the “Supply chain” section below). Such measures are complemented by compliance monitoring and supervisory actions such as audits, inspections, and checks carried out internally by the sub-contractors themselves, where appropriate, or with external providers (as part of the EcoVadis assessment on social and human rights, the environment, and responsible procurement).

SBM-2,,section 4.1.2.2 | section 4.1.4.1 | section 4.3 | 4.3.2,,,108 | 2024,375," Involvement of relevant stakeholdersThe Air France-KLM Group has created a map of its relevant stakeholders for its activities, which enables it to determine the ones that are relevant for the design and performance of its vigilance plan (for more information, please see section 4.1.2.2 “Interest and views of stakeholders (ESRS2 SBM-2)”).Several processes enable the Air France-KLM Group to regularly evaluate the perception of its stakeholders in respect of risks applicable to or generated by its activities. For instance, the Air France-KLM Group updates on a regular basis a materiality matrix to identify and assess non-financial risks (including ESG-related topics) to determine and adapt its strategy and actions for these matters. This matrix is done through interviews of internal and external stakeholders, internal stakeholder workshops, and a survey of external customers to get a complete overview of the impact of activities on ESG matters (for more information, see section 4.1.4.1 “Process to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities (IRO-1)”).The comparison of the results with previous analysis provided confirmation of the relevance of the Air France-KLM Group’s strategic choices in light of the issues deemed to be priorities for its activities and the expectations of its stakeholders. The Group also has several feedback channels in place enabling stakeholders (particularly employees, customers, and local residents around airports) to communicate any complaints, thus enabling the Group to identify matters of concern and risks and take them into account in its strategy and policies (for more information, see section 4.1.2.2 “Interest and views of stakeholders (ESRS2 SBM-2)”).Concerning the involvement of actors in the supply chain, the Air France-KLM Procurement department aims to work with suppliers as sustainable business partners based on mutual trust and collaboration and to promote responsible procurement standards and drive innovation and development. As an example, Air France-KLM has been part of the Carbon Disclosure Project Climate Module Assessment, where a selected group of the 108 of the highest greenhouse gas-emitting suppliers have been asked to complete a climate module assessment to help Air France-KLM better understand its suppliers' environmental impact and identify areas where the Air France-KLM Group and its suppliers can work together to reduce the carbon footprint.Eventually, the involvement of stakeholders is not limited to the identification of risks to be addressed through the duty-of-vigilance plan, but it is also used in the development of mitigating actions. For instance, Air France-KLM has participated in initiatives launched by professional associations and public actors to release communication campaigns against violence toward women and sexual tourism before and during the 2024 Paris Olympic and Paralympic Games, as this type of event provides the right timing for a warning to a large audience about the risk of these types of human rights violations.Measures deployed to prevent and mitigate risks; monitoring mechanismsSocial and human rights and fundamental liberties Within the organization, the risk factors to be addressed relate notably to discrimination, harassment, working conditions, gender equality and fair remuneration, freedom of association, collective bargaining, and social dialogue. For more information, see section 4.3 “Social Information”.The Group undertakes to comply with applicable labor legislation to ensure a safe and inclusive work environment, and with national collective agreements to respect the exercise of trade union rights.Within its organization, the Group delegates to its subsidiaries the responsibility of respecting and promoting the content of these commitments locally, in compliance with the national provisions and legislation specific to each country. The main measures implemented internally to mitigate risks related to social and human rights include:communication campaigns implemented through several channels: messages to employees, articles in the internal ■newsletter, or videos on the intranets;training campaigns: based on the identified risks, e-learnings are launched for a targeted panel of employees for ■which completion is mandatory. In 2024, e-learnings on the promotion of diversity, the fight against discrimination (with a focus on the recruitment process), and the fight against harassment and the prevention of sexism were available to employees on the internal training platform;commitment undertaken to achieve gender equality (signature of specific internal agreements);■network of persons dedicated to providing guidance on harassment situations in divisions;■events organized internally to promote diversity and inclusion.■Within the supply chain, the main risks to be addressed relate notably to discrimination, harassment, working conditions, forced labor and child labor, illegal employment, and own supply chain management of Tier 1 suppliers (see 4.3.2 “Workers in the value chain (ESRS S2)”.Mitigation actions consist of promoting our values regarding social and human rights to our business partners and requesting adherence to certain standards that are subject to regular controls (see the supply chain section below for information on due diligence and mitigating measures).

This also includes promoting access to training that leads to professions in the airline industry, through numerous associations and educational programs for young people. The Air France Group also promotes gender diversity externally and combats stereotypes in technical aviation careers by supporting initiatives aimed at promoting gender balance. This is demonstrated through the “Feminizing the aeronautics and space professions” charter and the “Elles bougent” association. For more information, please see section 4.3.1.5 “Diversity, Equity and Inclusion”. Air France and KLM continue to support workers with disabilities by using companies in the sheltered and adapted sector for multiple projects (e.g., the upkeep of green spaces at some sites, shipment of packages of uniforms, packaging of headphones used on board, laundering of on-board linens) and by entrusting them with critical services (four sheltered sector suppliers work with the Air France-KLM IT department). For more information, please see section 4.3.4.3.3 “Access to services for passengers with disabilities ”.Health and safety For Air France-KLM, the health and safety of both customers and staff is an absolute priority. Flight safety is key to retaining the trust of customers and imperative for the long-term viability of Air France-KLM operations. All the Group’s operations are the subject of multiple checks and certifications, and comply with extremely strict norms and the highest standards in the industry. Each airline of the Group deploys a Safety Management System, which is integral to their business organizations, processes, and corporate cultures. (For more information, please refer to Chapter 3 “Risks and risk management” and sections 4.3.1.4 “Working conditions for Air France-KLM staff” and 4.3.4.4 “Operational Safety & Security of Air Transportation (S4-1, S4-2, S4-3, S4-5, S4-4)”.)Safeguarding health and safety in the workplace is also a priority to which Air France-KLM responds by preventing occupational risks and improving the quality of life in the workplace. (For more information, please refer to section 4.3.1.4 “Working conditions for Air France-KLM staff”.) As part of the mitigating measures, trainings are implemented (such as e-learnings on security for managers), and audits are performed.EnvironmentThe identified risks mainly relate to climate change, air quality, noise, and waste management (see section 4.2 “Environmental information”).Risks are addressed through the Group Transition Plan, which sets forth the Group’s strategy and main priorities in terms of reducing its impact on climate change. The Air France and KLM Environmental Management Systems (EMSs) aim to prevent and mitigate the environmental impacts of their operations. These Environmental Management Systems have ISO 14001 certification, and internal and external audits enable the verification of their effective deployment.Awareness campaigns are launched within the Group to ensure that the employees understand and take into account the risks associated with climate change. E-learning materials as part of Climate School project within Air France have been deployed in 2024 to executives and managers and are to be opened to all employees in 2025 as a second phase. This training program is compulsory and elaborates on the specific risks and challenges for the aviation industry and the strategy implemented by the Air France-KLM Group for environmental transition. Please find more information in section 4.2.1 “Climate change (ESRS E1)”.Air France-KLM also launches initiatives with partners to mitigate the impact of the aviation sector on the environment. (For more information, please see section 4.1.2.2 “Interest and views of stakeholders (ESRS2 SBM-2)”.)Supply chain As a major purchaser of a wide range of products and services, the Air France-KLM Group integrates ethical and sustainability criteria into its supply chain by sourcing products and services that minimize its environmental footprint and create societal value.Concerning the business relationships with its sub-contractors and suppliers, Air France-KLM ensures that the fundamental human and social rights and environmental protection principles are properly addressed everywhere in the world, irrespective of the place of their registration and operations.The third-party due diligence process in place within its organization has been strengthened in 2024 to apply to new suppliers and service providers entering into a business relationship and deployed for the existing portfolio at the beginning of 2025. This due diligence process includes screening and due diligence that takes into account adverse media and appearances on sanctions lists that can be related to human rights incidents.In addition, the supplier selection process also includes an assessment to respond to the duty of vigilance requirements.
